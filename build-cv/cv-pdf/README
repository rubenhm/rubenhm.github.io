This is the repository for my CV in latex format.
The main file is Ruben_Hernandez-Murillo-cv.tex.
The bibliography in BiBTeX format is bibliography.bib.
This file is found in the repository for the website:
/home/ruben/repos/rubenhm.github.io/assets/bibliography/bibliography.bib.

The document is compiled with xelatex or lualatex using a `Makefile`.
After the first run of xelatex/lualatex and bibtex,
the resulting `.bbl` file is processed with the command
line utility `sed`.

The bibliography style is based on _IEEEtran.bst_.
