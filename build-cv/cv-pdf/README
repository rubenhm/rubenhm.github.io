This is the repository for my CV in latex format.
The main file is Ruben_Hernandez-Murillo-cv.tex.
The bibliography in BiBTeX format is bibliography.bib.
This file is found in the repository for the website:
/home/ruben/repos/rubenhm.github.io/assets/bibliography/bibliography.bib.



The document is compiled with XeLaTeX using the script compile-cv.sh.
The script uses the perl script fixbbl.pl.

The bibliography style is rhmIEEEtran.bst.
After the first run of xelatex and bibtex on Ruben_Hernandez-Murillo-cv
the resulting .bbl file has to be processed by the perl script to
add the \year{} command in the reference list.
After that, xelatex is run a couple more times.
