  loan pricing during 2005, the peak of the subprime mortgage expansion.
  We combine loan-level data on the performance of non-prime securitized
  mortgages with individual- and neighborhood-level data on racial
  and ethnic characteristics for metropolitan areas in California and
  Florida. Using a model of rate determination that accounts for predicted
  loan performance, we evaluate the differences in subprime mortgage
  rates in terms of racial and ethnic groups and neighborhood characteristics.
  We find evidence of adverse pricing for blacks and Hispanics. The
  evidence of adverse pricing is strongest for purchase mortgages and
  mortgages originated by non-depository institutions. },

  abstract = {In this paper we provide estimates of the coefficient of relative risk aversion using information on self-reports of subjective personal well-being from multiple datasets, including three cross-sectional surveys and two panel surveys, namely the Gallup World Poll, the European Social Survey, the World Values Survey, the British Household Panel Survey for the United Kingdom, and the General Social Survey for the United States. 
  We additionally consider the implications of allowing for health-state dependence in the utility function on the estimates of risk aversion and examine how the marginal utility of income changes in poor health states. 
  Our estimates of relative risk aversion with cross-section data vary closely around 1, which corresponds to logarithmic utility, while the estimates with panel data are slightly larger. 
  We find that controlling for health dependence generally reduces these estimates. In contrast with other studies in the literature, our results also suggest that the marginal utility of income increases when satisfaction with health deteriorates, and this effect is robust across the various datasets analyzed.},

  Using a panel of commercial banks in the United States for the period 2003--2006, we show that although bank-specific characteristics are important determinants of banks' adoption decisions, competition also plays a prominent role. 
  The extent of competition is related to the geographic overlap of banks in different markets and their relative market share in terms of deposits. In particular, banks adopt online banking services earlier in markets where their competitors have already adopted this technology.
  This paper is one of the first to construct local banking markets using the geographic market definitions delimited by the CASSIDI Database compiled at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.},

  We find that the Beige Book's national summary and District reports predict GDP and aggregate employment and that most District reports provide information content for regional employment. In addition, there appears to be an asymmetry in the predictive content of the Beige Book language.},

  Our results indicate that most fiscal policies have been converging and that the growth paths of state and local fiscal policies are not independent. In addition, we find that total expenditures have been converging faster than output, whereas total tax revenues have been converging slower than output.
  Our models further demonstrate that state expenditure growth is dependent on expenditure growth in economically and demographically similar states, while output growth and revenue growth in a state are dependent on output growth and revenue growth, respectively, in contiguous states.},

We also assume that potential licensees have private information about the usefulness of the new technology. \\ We characterize two purposes the optimal licensing contract serves to the patentholder: separation of the licensees and competition softening in the downstream market.

With identical communities, tax rates must be equal.\\ Finally, we examine the incentives of jurisdictions to harmonize tax rates and find that, whenever the smaller community benefits from tax harmonization, the larger jurisdiction will benefit also.},
