My name is Rubén Hernández-Murillo.

I am a economist, currently at the [Research Division](http://research.stlouisfed.org/) of the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.](http://www.stlouisfed.org)

My research interests include regional and urban economics, public economics and public finance, and industrial organization.

I attended [ITAM](http://economia.itam.mx/es) in Mexico City and the [University of Rochester](http://www.econ.rochester.edu) in Rochester, NY.


In this website I publicize my research and publications. The main input for this effort is my [bibliography](/assets/bibliography/bibliography.bib) file in BibTeX format.


The source files for this website are hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/rubenhm/rubenhm.github.io/tree/source).
